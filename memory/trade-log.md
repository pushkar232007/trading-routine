# Trade Log

_Bull: append a new entry every time you place, close, or deliberately skip a trade. Newest
entries at the top. Keep each entry to a few lines — this file gets read often, so don't bloat it._

## 2026-06-24 01:11 — SKIP (market closed)
- Qty / price / stop: none — no order placed.
- Reasoning: "market-open" routine fired at 01:11 ET, ~8h before the 09:30 ET open. `alpaca.py clock`
  returned `is_open: false`. Cannot execute the pre-market plan (META ~5% starter) while the market
  is closed. Plan stands for the actual open: initiate META starter w/ 10% trailing stop, hold off MU
  (earnings tonight) + FDX (let dip settle), stay cautious into Thu Jun 26 PCE.
- Guardrail check: n/a — no trade attempted.
- Note: routine scheduled at wrong time (timezone/cron likely off). Account unchanged: $100k cash, flat.
