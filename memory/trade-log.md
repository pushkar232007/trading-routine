# Trade Log

_Bull: append a new entry every time you place, close, or deliberately skip a trade. Newest
entries at the top. Keep each entry to a few lines — this file gets read often, so don't bloat it._

## 2026-06-24 01:29 — NO-OP (market-close wrap, no positions)
- Qty / price / stop: none — no order placed.
- Reasoning: "market-close" routine fired at 01:29 ET (~8h before the 09:30 open; clock `is_open: false`).
  Account still fully in cash: $100k equity, $0 positions, $0 day P/L. No trades were placed today because
  every routine fired pre-open. Nothing to wrap — logged the day, refreshed portfolio snapshot, sent EOD
  Telegram summary. META starter plan carries forward to the next real open.
- Guardrail check: n/a — no trade attempted.
- Note: routine timing offset is now a logged recurring issue (see signals-learnings.md → Process notes).

## 2026-06-24 01:26 — NO-OP (midday risk check, no positions)
- Qty / price / stop: none — no order placed.
- Reasoning: "midday" risk-check routine fired at 01:26 ET (~8h before the 09:30 open; clock `is_open: false`).
  `alpaca.py positions` returned `[]` — account still fully in cash ($100k equity, $0 positions). Nothing to
  risk-check: no position down -7% to cut, no winner to tighten a stop on. Pre-market META starter was never
  executed (market-open routine also fired pre-open). Plan unchanged: initiate META ~5% starter w/ 10% trailing
  stop at the real open; hold off MU/FDX; cautious into Thu Jun 26 PCE.
- Guardrail check: n/a — no trade attempted.
- Note: routines still firing ~8h early (timezone/cron offset). Recurring issue — flag for fix.

## 2026-06-24 01:11 — SKIP (market closed)
- Qty / price / stop: none — no order placed.
- Reasoning: "market-open" routine fired at 01:11 ET, ~8h before the 09:30 ET open. `alpaca.py clock`
  returned `is_open: false`. Cannot execute the pre-market plan (META ~5% starter) while the market
  is closed. Plan stands for the actual open: initiate META starter w/ 10% trailing stop, hold off MU
  (earnings tonight) + FDX (let dip settle), stay cautious into Thu Jun 26 PCE.
- Guardrail check: n/a — no trade attempted.
- Note: routine scheduled at wrong time (timezone/cron likely off). Account unchanged: $100k cash, flat.
